			<h3>Why use Clarity?</h3>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>COVID-19 has destroyed and torn apart so many things. Families. Lives. And with its impacts more visible than ever before, we see the impacts that it has on students. Mental and physical health has decreased so much for students. There are so many different reasons and factors that need to be considered when thinking about students' mental health, but a major part of the drastic decrease is the decreased accessibility to education and learning. This is why one major part of Clarity is about helping students with different topics. Another major problem, is that through COVID-19, the pressure to get better grades and test scores has risen. That is why Clarity has an AP help page, a resource page, and all of the links used for Clarity will be linked. On the other hand, there are ways to improve mental and physical health directly. That is why Clarity also provides resources, such as relaxing sounds and music students can use while studying and a physical exercise section. Clarity aims to help and aid students who need it, and hopefully change some lives for the better. </p>

			<h3>About Alison (the creator of Clarity)</h3>
			
			<br>
			
			<p>Hi, I'm Alison! A little about me: I'm a high school student as of right now (2021), I love listening to music, I love coding (in all sorts of ways, Python, Swift, HTML, Visual Basic, pretty much everything), I love drawing (in fact, all of the images you will ever see on my projects will always be hand drawn by me :)) I also love Speech and Debate, I love tea, I love coffee, and I love reading. I created Clarity to help students in all sorts of different ways, including mentally, physically, and academically, especially in such a time as chaotic as COVID-19. It really has taken a toll on every student, and I have experienced it all first hand (remember, I'm a student too). I haven't really seen too many websites that actually combine these three aspects into something that was easy to access and read. I hope this website helps you, and I hope to expand Clarity in the future! :)</p>
