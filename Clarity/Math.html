			<h3>Some Math Tips for Success</h3>
			
			<p>There are many different things that you need to keep in mind in order to be good at math:</p>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Being good at math is NOT a measure of intelligence. It just proves how much you are determined to understand the concept. There is no such thing as "being naturally talened" at math. Everything is learned. It might come easier to some, but everybody can master it. If you don't study or put in the work, you just won't understand it.</li>
				<li>This point is also very connected with number one. STUDY. STUDY. STUDY. Study doesn't just mean stare at the numbers. It doesn't mean memorize every way and possiblity to solve a problem. If you study smartly you won't have any problem with any of the questions that will be thrown at you. Study SMARTLY. Study the concept and not the numbers. If you know how to approach the problem, you will likely be able to solve it using tatics you already know.</li>
				<li>Lastly, imagine math is a pyramid. The base is the core skills, like add, multipling, ect. The things you learn at a very young age. These are the skill you will see repeated the most. They'll be "used" the most, and are the core skills you need to know to move on. Then, you have the next layers. These are the skills you'd probably see more in Algebra 2, and up. These are the skills that are less crucial to know, but if you want to continue to other levels of math, you'd probably want to know these. Then, you're at the top of pyramid. These are math skills that are much more rare, and specific towards each subject/kind of math. You probably won't need these skills unless you are intrested in the field of math. The thing about math is that if you don't learn the core skills. The lesson is to be careful, and not rush through the easier parts by slacking :)</li>
				<li>Math can be fun! Seriously... Just find ways that makes it more fun/easier for you. Play things like Kahoot or Quizziz with friends. This can make studying just a little more fun (or competitive, depends on how you are).
				</li>
